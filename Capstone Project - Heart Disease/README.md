Heart Disease Prediction 
 - 

Heart Disease is a continous problem in today's world; And undestanding where disease kicks in is what need look into. 
The goal of the capstone project is to predict whether or not a patient had heart disease based on of their age. 

Data features include the following: 
- age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol
- fbs, restecg, thalach, exang
- oldpeak, slope, ca, and thal     


In Heart Disease Data Wrangling.ipynb, a Pandas HTML report helped us quickly identify outliers, missing data, duplicate rows of data and correlation charts. From this, we had the ability to clean up some data and prepare it for the Exploratory Data Analysis. 

In Heart Disease EDA.ipynb, we read in the heart_disease data file, and 

In Heart Disease - Preprocessing, Training, Modeling.ipynb the Linear Regression model, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor, and Neural Network models are explored.
